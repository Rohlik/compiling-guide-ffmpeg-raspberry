Sorry for my bad english

in some cases you must remove sudo in scripts

sudo ninja install dont work on debian 10, on ubuntu and buster no problem
ninja install - open a window with passwot on debian bullseye
sudo make install works fine on all distros

in ffmpeg.sh or mpv.sh you can change the options and remove or add some

apt build-dep ffmpeg mpv do not install all you must compile something you need or delete the option


This scripts are multimedia scripts for rpi 4 3b+

you can install ffmpeg with all codecs mpv all codecs laspa equalizer and pulseeffects

all is running with hwaccel  and the cpu is cool
